Currently, I have a solution, which I attempted to use the
nearest neighbor problem. I broke that problem
into a sub problems. I used a helper function to help 
find the minimum distance between vertices.
My algorithm takes in a list of strings with the distances,
each separated by a new line. I modeled my code off of the extreme algorithms site
specifically with the nearest neighbor (https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~simhaweb/champalg/tsp/tsp.html).
I would say sitting down in office hours helped with this assignment as I was overthinking this assignment out.
